# Inclusora

 Even if unintentionally, people can use language to spread harmful ideas. To create a more welcoming world for all, Inclusora is a website that checks if a text is written in an inclusive way. After the user inputs a piece of writing, such as an essay, an email, or even a simple text message, they get a report on how they can change their writing to be more inclusive. For instance, some of the suggestions include replacing “he or she” with “they”, “guys” with “folks”, and “handicapped” with “person with a disability”. This way, Inclusora focuses on inclusion, one word at a time.
 
 
 ### MVP
 
 The MVP of Inclusora is composed of a simple text area and a button. In the text area, the user can enter any text and after pressing the button, the text will be processed and checked if it contains any words that could be harmful to some people. These trigger words, as well as suggestions to replace them, will be stored internally. Afterward, the same page will be reloaded, but with the noninclusive words highlighted. After clicking on a highlighted word, the user will see a short explanation of why that word is not a good choice and see suggestions of what words could be used instead.
 
 ### Installation
 
 To install the code on your own machine, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as well as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Angular](https://angular.io/). After that, install dependencies and run the code by typing the command  ```npm start``` in the console.
